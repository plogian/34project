Variables. 

The variables of the dataset are listed below. 

The first variable, activity, lists one of six activities: walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, and laying.

The second variable, subject, lists the number of the subject (1-30) for whom the data is recorded. 

The rest of the variables are unchanged from the original dataset.

Data
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.
